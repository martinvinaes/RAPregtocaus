# RAPregtocaus

Replication materials for the article "Regression to Causality: Regression-style presentation influences causal attribution". 

This repository contains the following files:
	
	1. `regtocaus.dta` - data from the surveys.
	2. `regtocaus_code.do` - do file creating tables and figures.

Note that tables are produced in latex format, and the formatting is therefore a little different from that used in the article.
